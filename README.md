# LIRIBOT
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## LIRI uses the following commands:
```
spotify-this-song
```
```
movie-this
```
```
do-what-it-says
```
## Technologies used:

* Node.js
* Javascript
